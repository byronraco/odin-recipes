            <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the middle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Make the suya spice coating: Combine the peanuts, ginger, paprika, granulated garlic, granulated onion, cayenne and salt in a mini food processor or blender, pulsing until the peanut bits are the size of panko bread crumbs. Tip into a small bowl. Add the panko, breaking up any large chunks with your fingertips, then stir in the minced garlic and olive oil.</li>
            <li>Prep the salmon: Place the salmon, skin side down, on the baking sheet, leaving space between each fillet. Season on top with salt and pepper. Spoon the suya spice coating over the top of each salmon fillet, lightly pressing to adhere. (Don't worry about the sides.)</li>
            <li>Roast until the coating is golden brown and salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 12 minutes. Serve with your desired side dishes.</li>
