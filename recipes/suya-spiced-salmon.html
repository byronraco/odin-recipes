        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Traditionally used to season grilled meat skewers in Nigeria, suya spice (also called yaji) is a spicy peanut-based blend that brings a bold, layered flavor to anything you are throwing on the grill â€” and it has plenty of other uses, too. Here, the coarsely ground peanuts in the suya meld with panko to give the crunchiest crust to roasted salmon while adding a Nigerian spin. Using a bit of oil helps the panko mixture cling to the fillets, creating a crispy, flavorful dish that pairs perfectly with rice and a fresh cucumber and tomato salad.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup roasted unsalted peanuts</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>1teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1teaspoon granulated garlic </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the middle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Make the suya spice coating: Combine the peanuts, ginger, paprika, granulated garlic, granulated onion, cayenne and salt in a mini food processor or blender, pulsing until the peanut bits are the size of panko bread crumbs. Tip into a small bowl. Add the panko, breaking up any large chunks with your fingertips, then stir in the minced garlic and olive oil.</li>
            <li>Prep the salmon: Place the salmon, skin side down, on the baking sheet, leaving space between each fillet. Season on top with salt and pepper. Spoon the suya spice coating over the top of each salmon fillet, lightly pressing to adhere. (Don't worry about the sides.)</li>
            <li>Roast until the coating is golden brown and salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 12 minutes. Serve with your desired side dishes.</li>

        </ol>
